I am a Sociology PhD Candidate at Duke University, and will be defending my dissertation in March 2026. My advisor is James Moody, and my research is primarily on the topics of social network analysis and health.

I am on the job market! If you are looking for someone who has skills in social network analysis, data science, quantitative/computational social science research, or programming languages, please feel free to email me at madelynn.wellons@duke.edu.
